This project is about building a program that imitates the bash shell, more exactly the command sh.

Our shell works in interactive as well as non-interactive modes.
It also operates basic commands with or without the path.

On error, our shell shows an error message with appropriate context and exit status.
The shell could be exited either through the ' exit ' command or by Ctrl + D.
